## 🧩 Who I Am

17. Building, breaking, and occasionally fixing things that probably shouldn't work — but somehow do. I like my projects like I like my code: fast, messy, and (eventually) functional.

Right now, I'm deep into:
- 🧠 Predicting temperatures with ML because thermodynamics is too slow  
- 🔩 Programming microcontrollers to act smarter than me  
- 📊 Trading manually, algorithmically, and sometimes emotionally  
- ⚙️ Hackathons — where chaos meets caffeine and turns into working prototypes  

Didn’t go to Stanford. But I *did* graduate from ChatGPT University — with honors in “stack overflowing at 3 AM.”
